# Flashcards
Interactive flashcard application that allows users to create and edit various decks of study flashcards. One aspect I enjoy about this app is the ability to view all cards within a deck on one page, or go through each card one by one to study. This allows the user to customize their study approach and provides more flexbility.

## Improvements
Some features that I would like to add is the ability to search for decks based on keywords. This provides the option for large scale handling of study decks that can be shared with others. This is currently a sample project and not connected to a live database, but having a live version would allow for groups of user to access current study decks from different locations. One option even being a user authentication to allow for personalized study decks or private use by organizations or teachers. 
I would also like to enhance the functionality and provide the option to randomize the cards within a deck. Or include a progress bar so you can track your progress within a deck.
